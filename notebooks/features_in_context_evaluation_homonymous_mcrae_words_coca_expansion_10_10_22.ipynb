Detailed studies on bat sociality are rare, however, when compared with the information available for other social mammals, such as primates, carnivores, ungulates, and rodents. Modern field technologies and new molecular methods are now providing opportunities to study aspects of bat biology that were previously inaccessible. Consequently, bat social systems are emerging as farmore complex than had been imagined. Variable dispersal patterns, complex olfactory and acoustic communication, flexible context-related interactions, striking cooperative behaviors, and cryptic colony structures in the form of fission-fusion systems have been documented.

Detailed studies on bat sociality are rare, however, when compared with the information available for other social mammals, such as primates, carnivores, ungulates, and rodents. Modern field technologies and new molecular methods are now providing opportunities to study aspects of bat biology that were previously inaccessible. Consequently, bat social systems are emerging as farmore complex than had been imagined. Variable dispersal patterns, complex olfactory and acoustic communication, flexible context-related interactions, striking cooperative behaviors, and cryptic colony structures in the form of fission-fusion systems have been documented.

Avoidance of local resource competition with females may be an explanation for male dispersal in some species , such as the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), the Daubenton's bat, and the particolored bat (Vespertilio murinus), whose males, after theirdispersal, select habitats separate from the females (Barclay 1991, Senior et al. 2005, Sail et al. 2007). However, in other species, such as the Bechstein's bat, dispersing males   \n",

Rousettusleschenaulti can be used as a useful non-primate laboratory model to study menstruation and menstrual dysfunctions in human beings as these bats exhibit a human like menstrual cycle both morphologically and physiologically (Zhang et al., 2007).   \n",

In the presence of mink, the islands with the most diverse breeding bird communities were those most isolated, and the removal of mink resulted in a redistribution of birds across the archipelago that was unrelated to distance betweenislands (Nordstrm and Korpimki 2004). Mesocarnivores may also influence communities on much larger spatial scales.
